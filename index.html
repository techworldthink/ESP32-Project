    <p>
        The ESP32 is a very inexpensive versatile chip designed for efficient Wi-Fi and Bluetooth including BLE. It has
        a powerful 240MHz dual core microcontroller with 520K of SRAM. It is designed for mobile devices so it has
        ultra-low power consumption. The ESP32 chip has 32 GPIO pins with support for I2C, I2S, SPI and UART. In
        addition it has multiple analog to digital channels and digital to analog, hardware accelerated encryption,
        pulse width modulation, capacitance touch interfaces and a lot more.

        The ESP32 is a more powerful successor to the very popular ESP8266. The following chart compares the specs.
    </p>
    <div class="img"><img src="images/neon led/0.jpg" onclick="enlargeImg(this)"></div>
    <p>
        One of the main reasons I like the ESP32 and the ESP8266 is that you can program them in Python. More
        specifically, MicroPython, which is a very efficient streamlined version of the Python 3 programming language
        that is optimized to run on microcontrollers, such as the ESP32.

        The Raspberry Pi is great for many projects, but it is a full-fledged computer with a Linux operating system.
        For simple repetitive task such as monitoring sensors and controlling relays it’s often easier, cheaper, more
        reliable and more efficient to use a microcontroller such as an Arduino which boots up instantly and just runs
        your program. Arduinos such as the Uno are usually programmed using a set of the C language using the Arduino
        IDE, which can also be used to program the ESP32. Instead of C, this tutorial focuses on MicroPython, which
        works great when integrating with a Raspberry Pi because you can use Python on both devices for all the code.

        To get started the MicroPython firmware needs to be uploaded to the ESP32. This can be done with a simple
        micro-USB cable which provides a 2 way serial interface between the Pi and the ESP32. It also provides 5 volts
        to power the ESP32.
    </p>
    <div class="img"><img src="images/neon led/2.png" onclick="enlargeImg(this)"></div>
    <p>
        Before uploading the firmware, please make sure the Pi is up-to-date. From a terminal, type the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade</code></pre>
    <p>
        I recommend you use the latest version of Raspbian to ensure you have all the necessary software.

        A utility called ESPTool is used to upload the MicroPython firmware to the ESP32. It is installed using pip3 to
        target Python3:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo pip3 install esptool</code></pre>
    <p>
        Next the USB port needs to be determined using dmesg | grep ttyUSB. The results should show a CP210x UART to USB
        bridge attached to a USB port. Below the port is ttyUSB0.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
dmesg | grep ttyUSB 
[11.263101] usb 1-1.4: cp210x converter now attached to ttyUSB0
        </code></pre>

    <p>
        Some boards need to be put in programming mode using the push buttons on the board before you can use the
        ESPtool. However, I’ve found that it’s not necessary on the ESP32 (at least not on mine.) The ESPTool flash_id
        command can be used to ensure everything is working. Specify the port with double dash port followed by /dev/
        and the port name returned by the dmesg command above.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 flash_id
esptool.py v2.0.1

        </code></pre>

    <p>
        The query returns basic info such as the chip type (ESP32) and flash size (4 MB). Before uploading the firmware
        it is recommended to erase the ESP32, which can also be done with the ESPTool:
    </p>
    <pre><code>esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
</code></pre>
    <p>
        A copy of the MicroPython firmware is required. You could build it yourself from the source code on the
        MicroPython GitHub ESP32 repo, but is much easier to just download a ready-to-go daily build.

        Once the firmware is downloaded it can be uploaded with the ESPTool using the write_flash command. The hex value
        indicates the starting memory address and it is followed by the path to the downloaded MicroPython ESP32
        firmware file.

        <b>UPDATE:</b> the starting address now needs to be 0x1000 instead of zero.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x1000 path_to_firmware_file
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        MicroPython boards have a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) which is a simple interactive programming environment.
        It’s similar to the Python Idle shell. On the ESP32, the REPL is accessed using a serial connection. Other
        boards like the ESP8266, which is the predecessor to the ESP32, also have a Web REPL which allows you to manage
        and program them over the web. <strike>Currently, this feature has not yet been implemented on the ESP32 along
            with many
            other features, but new stuff is being added daily so there might be more options in the future.</strike>
        The ESP32 now
        supports Web REPL, but you can only transfer 1 file at a time (no folders), the security is very weak and it’s
        buggy. For now we’ll stick to serial. The same USB cable that was used to upload the ESP32 firmware can also be
        used to access the REPL. Any serial program such as PuTTY or Screen should work with the REPL. However, these
        programs won’t let you manage the ESP32 file system which can be used to store your programs. Actually you can
        access some file commands by writing Python code, but this is cumbersome and still does not provide for file
        transfers between the ESP32 and the Pi. Ideally you want a program that provides a REPL terminal and also can
        perform file management. I’ve tried several programs and currently my favorite is rshell. It can be installed
        using pip:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
sudo pip3 install rshell
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        This simple program will run on the Raspberry Pi and allow you to access the REPL terminal on the ESP32. It also
        provides file management to transfer and manipulate files on both the Pi and the ESP32. To start rshell, type
        rshell and specify 30 for the buffer size and your USB port:
    </p>
    <pre><code>rshell --buffer-size=30 -p /dev/ttyUSB0 </code></pre>
    <p>
        The first prompt can be used to execute file commands. For example, type boards to get a list of connected
        boards. The first line returned should start with the board ID which for my ESP32 is pyboard.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
/home/pi> boards 
pyboard @ /dev/ttyUSB0 connected Dirs: /boot.py
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        The boot.py file is automatically run at startup and contains code to set up the board and finish booting. You
        typically don’t want to edit it. However, you can add a file called main.py if you need your own code to run at
        start up after the boot.py.

        Type repl to open the MicroPython programing environment. The terminal will now accept Python code. For example,
        print hello world, outputs hello world.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
/home/pi> repl
Entering REPL. Use Control-X to exit.

        Next, let’s upload a MicroPython program to control a NeoPixel LED on the ESP32. A NeoPixel is an RGB led with a
        built in chip (usually WS2812B or SK6812) to control color and brightness. It can be controlled using a single
        data line. They are often sold in strips with multiple LED’s, but for this demo a single 8mm LED is used. These
        single 8mm LED’s can also be daisy-chained using a single data line.
    </p>
    <div class="img"><img src="images/neon led/3.jpg" onclick="enlargeImg(this)"></div>
    <p>
        It is very easy to connect a NeoPixel to the ESP32. A 5 V pin provides power. A 1N4004 diode is used to drop the
        voltage from 5 V to 4.3 V which allows the NeoPixel to read the ESP32’s 3.3 V output. The ESP32 3.3 V data
        output needs to be at least 70% of the NeoPixel’s supply voltage. At 5 V it’s outside this range at 66% but at
        4.3 V it’s good to go at 76%. A ground from the ESP32 is connected to the ground on the NeoPixel. GPIO 13 is
        connected to the data in. Please note that a single NeoPixel can use up to 60mA at full brightness. Therefore,
        if you want to run a strip of LED’s, please use an external power source to avoid damaging the board and it
        would be preferable to use a level shifter on the data line instead of the diode approach.
    </p>
    <div class="img"><img src="images/neon led/4.png" onclick="enlargeImg(this)"></div>
    <p>
        Here’s the MicroPython code to control the NeoPixel. The Pin library is very similar to the Raspberry Pi GPIO
        library. It lets you reference and control the ESP32 GPIO pins. The NeoPixel library drives NeoPixel LED’s and
        strips.

        Since MicroPython is a subset of Python, it doesn’t have all the standard libraries. For example, an easy way to
        cycle RGB LED colors is to vary the hue between 0 and 1. This can be done with the hsv_to_rgb method which is
        part of the Python colorsys library. It’s not included with MicroPython, but I can just add the function I need
        to the code. HSV is a common cylindrical-coordinate representation of points in an RGB color model. The
        hsv_to_rgb function simply converts an HSV value (hue, saturation and brightness) to an RGB value (red, green,
        blue).
    </p>

    <pre><code>

"""NeoPixel LED Demo."""
from machine import Pin

    """
    if s == 0.0:

    t = v * (1.0 - s * (1.0 - f))
    i = i % 6

np = NeoPixel(Pin(13), 1)
spectrum = list(range(2048)) + list(reversed(range(2048)))


try:
    while True:
        for c in spectrum:
            hue = c / 2048.0
            np[0] = hsv_to_rgb(hue, 1, .15)
            np.write()
            sleep(.01)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print ("\nCtrl-C pressed.  Cleaning up and exiting...")
finally:
    np[0] = (0, 0, 0)  # Turn off NeoPixel
    np.write()
        
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        A NeoPixel is instantiated, on GPIO pin 13. One indicates the number of LED’s. Spectrum is a list to represent
        2048 colors. The first range is zero to 2047 and the 2nd is 2047 to zero. A try statement to catch errors wraps
        the main while loop which is infinite. A for loop cycles through the color spectrum range (0 to 2047 and back to
        0). Hue is set to a value from 0 to 1 (divided into 2048 steps.) NP[0] refers to the first NeoPixel LED. In this
        case, there is only one. If we were using a strip we could reference other LED’s using other numbers. The
        hsv_to_rgb function is passed the hue, 1 for saturation and brightness is set to 15%. The np.write method sets
        the NeoPixel LED to the previously specified color. The loop sleeps for ten milliseconds and continues. Except
        is used to gracefully exit the program on ctrl-C. Finally ensures the LED is turned off on exit by setting red,
        green and blue to zeros.

        Back in rshell type ctrl-X if you are still in the REPL to exit back to the main rshell terminal. Navigate to
        the folder where the program is saved. You can use cd and ls just like in a regular terminal. Then use cp to
        copy the program file to the ESP32 which is specified with /pyboard:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
/home/pi/Documents> cp rgb.py /pyboard
    </code></pre>
    <p>Type repl to return the REPL and type import rgb to run the rgb.py program.</p>
